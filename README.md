This project is completly done on jupyter notebook
Here I have used pandas for the data cleaning or the conversion or merging the files 
initially i have converted to .xlsx and extract the table in the pdf and analyze the data and cleaned it using pandas
Then their is Excel file that contain different sheets called Summary, Payout Breakup Tab, Order Level and Commission Invoive. Which is uncleaned data or let's say data was not in required format. So i read the single sheets in the file analyze and cleaned it.
The final step is that after clean the data and created new excel sheet. I have merged it for the original file using pandas concat function. 
Data Analyst Quick Assignment = The original file that i have to convert the file format.
Commission Invoice.py, Order_ Level.py, Payout_Break.py, summary_tab.py, commission_converter.py, merging.py These are the .py files or python files with pandas where respective to invoice_Annexure_408_09042025_1744207092917.xlsx file for first 4 python files,taco_Tax_Invoice_408_09042025_250409FS29010820.pdf for commission_converter.py python file.
